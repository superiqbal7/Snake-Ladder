SnakeAndLadder

Snakes and Ladders It is an ancient Indian board game regarded today as a worldwide classic. It is played between two or more players on a game board having numbered, griddle squares. A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped or hindered by ladders and snakes respectively.

Why we choose Java? Beginner Friendliness Generally, Java was designed to be relatively beginner-friendly in that it assumes the programmer is not that smart or careful, so programmers will be less likely to shoot themselves in the foot when coding Java apps. Easier to Maintain Java is a statically-typed language, which means your code will have to be checked for errors before it can be built into an app. This means errors will be easier to track down. Furthermore, since statically-typed languages are also more strict with the definitions of things, you will have less strange and unexpected errors, which means your codebase will be easier to maintain as it grows in size and complexity. Fast As a statically typed language, Java is faster than dynamically typed languages because things are more clearly defined. Thus, when the app is running, your machine's resources will not be wasted on checking the definition of something in your code.

Challanges

Major:

Implementing our console game & algorithm to in GUI.
Working with labels.
Fixing bugs.
When one disc is playing others were not showed. We fixed it.
When we moved one disc others were moved also. We fixed it.
Who is Winner and Who is looser.
Using thread. (our next implementation will be it is)
From Single Player to Multiplayer shifting.
Future Plan

Using Thread making this game more perfect. Make it upgradeable Using socket server programming making it multiplayer usable from anywhere. Background music Running from facebook Chatroom In future implement this game with applet/javafx instead of java swing.
